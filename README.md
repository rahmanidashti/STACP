Joint Geographical and Temporal Modeling based on Matrix Factorization for Point-of-Interest Recommendation (ECIR 2020)

## Environment Settings
- Python version:  '2.7'
- You have to install the required libraries

## To run the code
You need just run the `recommendation.py`

The `TimeAwareMF.py` lib is implemented in `Python 2`. Therefore you should run the model with `Python 2`.

- To change the dataset, you have to write its name in the `recommendation.py`.
